YearsENERGYSTARCertifiedYears the property has received ENERGY STAR certification.

ENERGYSTARScoreAn EPA calculated 1-100 rating that assesses a property’s overall energy performance, based on national data to control for differences among climate, building uses, and operations. A score of 50 represents the national median.

SiteEUI(kBtu/sf)Site Energy Use Intensity (EUI) is a property's Site Energy Use divided by its gross floor area. Site Energy Use is the annual amount of all the energy consumed by the property on-site, as reported on utility bills. Site EUI is measured in thousands of British thermal units (kBtu) per square foot.

SiteEUIWN(kBtu/sf)Weather Normalized (WN) Site Energy Use Intensity (EUI) is a property's WN Site Energy divided by its gross floor area (in square feet). WN Site Energy is the Site Energy Use the property would have consumed during 30-year average weather conditions. WN Site EUI is measured in measured in thousands of British thermal units (kBtu) per square foot.

SourceEUI(kBtu/sf)Source Energy Use Intensity (EUI) is a property's Source Energy Use divided by its gross floor area. Source Energy Use is the annual energy used to operate the property, including losses from generation, transmission, & distribution. Source EUI is measured in thousands of British thermal units (kBtu) per square foot.

SourceEUIWN(kBtu/sf)Weather Normalized (WN) Source Energy Use Intensity (EUI) is a property's WN Source Energy divided by its gross floor area. WN Source Energy is the Source Energy Use the property would have consumed during 30-year average weather conditions. WN Source EUI is measured in measured in thousands of British thermal units (kBtu) per square foot.

SiteEnergyUse(kBtu)The annual amount of energy consumed by the property from all sources of energy.

SiteEnergyUseWN(kBtu)The annual amount of energy consumed by the property from all sources of energy, adjusted to what the property would have consumed during 30-year average weather conditions.

SteamUse(kBtu)The annual amount of district steam consumed by the property on-site, measured in thousands of British thermal units (kBtu).

Electricity(kWh)The annual amount of electricity consumed by the property on-site, including electricity purchased from the grid and generated by onsite renewable systems, measured in kWh.

Electricity(kBtu)The annual amount of electricity consumed by the property on-site, including electricity purchased from the grid and generated by onsite renewable systems, measured in thousands of British thermal units (kBtu).

NaturalGas(therms)The annual amount of utility-supplied natural gas consumed by the property, measured in therms.

NaturalGas(kBtu)The annual amount of utility-supplied natural gas consumed by the property, measured in thousands of British thermal units (kBtu).

DefaultDataThe property used default data for at least one property characteristic.

CommentsComments by a building owner or agent to provide context to the building’s energy use.

ComplianceStatusWhether a property has met energy benchmarking requirements for the current reporting year.

OutlierWhether a property is a high or low outlier (Y/N)

TotalGHGEmissionsThe total amount of greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide gases released into the atmosphere as a result of energy consumption at the property, measured in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. This calculation uses a GHG emissions factor from Seattle CIty Light's portfolio of generating resources. This uses Seattle City Light's 2015 emissions factor of 52.44 lbs CO2e/MWh until the 2016 factor is available. Enwave steam factor = 170.17 lbs CO2e/MMBtu. Gas factor sourced from EPA Portfolio Manager = 53.11 kg CO2e/MBtu.

GHGEmissionsIntensityTotal Greenhouse Gas Emissions divided by property's gross floor area, measured in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent per square foot. This calculation uses a GHG emissions factor from Seattle City Light's portfolio of generating resources
